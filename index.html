  Privacy Policy

Effective date: 19 February 2026

VI Speed Dial ("the App") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data.

1. Information We Collect

The App may request access to:

Contacts (to allow users to assign contacts to speed dial buttons)

Phone permissions (to initiate phone calls)

The App does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data with any third party.

All contact data remains stored locally on the user’s device.

2. Data Sharing

We do not sell, share, or transfer user data to any third party.

3. Data Storage

The App does not use any remote servers or cloud storage. All data remains on the user's device.

4. Security

Since no data is transmitted externally, user data remains under the control of the device owner.

5. Children’s Privacy

The App is not specifically directed toward children under 13, but it does not collect any personal information.

6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be reflected on this page.
